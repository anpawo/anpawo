# Hi, I'm Marius Rousset
- I'm currently studying at Epitech Paris in 4th year.
- I like to write optimized code, templated stuff and to automate repetitive tasks.


## I'm Currently Working On
- [Video-Code](https://github.com/anpawo/Video-Code) (2024-Now)
  - A video editing software.  
  - The goal is to transform code into videos.  
## What I've done so far
- [Mary](https://github.com/anpawo/Glados-Mary) (2024)
  - A programming language made in Haskell.
  - Standard Lib includes I/O, random, structures, lambdas (closure) and atoms.
- [My-Lib-C](https://github.com/anpawo/C-Lib) (2022-2023)
  - A library made in C with standard functions.
  - The style is Object Oriented (don't ask why).
- Notif-Pogo (2022-2023)
  - A bot discord that scrapes Pokemon Go Spawns all around the world.
  - Very generic, could handle a wide variety of filters.
